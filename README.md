# VDC Intervention Analysis Tool
This project investigates the excessive control or early activation of Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC). The analysis is implemented using Python and can be run through the `Robust_Tool.py` script.

## Features
- Investigates the over-control or premature activation of VDC.
- Selects relevant data for analysis.
- Executes the analysis using the `Robust_Tool.py` script.

## Requirements
- Python

## How to Use

## Workflow
1. **Data Selection**:  
   Choose the relevant data files for analysis.
2. **Analysis Execution**:  
   Run the `Robust_Tool.py` script to analyze the VDC intervention, looking for excessive control or early activation.
3. **Results**:  
   The script will generate analysis results and insights based on the selected data.

## Results
The tool outputs:
- Analysis of VDC behavior with respect to over-control and early activation.
- Relevant visualizations or reports to aid in understanding VDC performance.
